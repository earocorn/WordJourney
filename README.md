# WordJourney
Word Journey is a fun word-guessing game for everyone. The game plays off the classic word guessing games, but with added elements. 
The objective is to guess a secret 5-letter word that is randomly generated in under 6 guesses or before the timer runs out.

All your guesses must be real words, according to the dictionary of 5-letter words that we have chosen.
When you get a word correct you gain a point, and with those points you will be able to move on to another level.
The game has 11 levels that consist of getting two words correct Wordles to move on to the next level.
